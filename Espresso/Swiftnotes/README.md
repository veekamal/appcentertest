# Building & running tests locally
## Building
Steps on how to build Swiftnotes:
1. Make sure you have Android Studio with _at minimum_ Gradle v4.1 and Android SDK Tools (26.1.1 Build tools).
2. Open the project using *Android Studio > File > Open*
3. Select *build.gradle* in Swiftnotes. (Picking another directory may still seem to open the project, but cause trouble building.)
4. Go to *File > Project Structure > SDK Location* and make sure Android SDK and JDK paths are set.
5. Select *Build > Rebuild Project*

## Running tests
To run tests locally:
1. Make sure you can build the app (see above)
2. Navigate in Android Studio to *app > java > com.moonpi.swifnotes (androidTest) > CreateNoteTest*
3. Right-click *CreateNoteTest* and select *Run 'CreateNoteTest'*
4. Select a device or emulator from the dialog to install the app and run the tests. 

# Uploading app & tests
1. Build the app & tests locally. (Running locally is optional but a good idea)
2. Generate a command line for upload. [Directions](/../../#upload-commands)
3. Run the upload command with project-specific arguments:
   - **OS X** paste your command as the value for 'AppCenter_Test_Command' in 'upload.sh'. In terminal navigate to the Maven folder and run 'sh upload.sh' to upload to AppCenter/Test
   - **Windows** The 'upload.sh' file is not technically compatible with Windows, however it shows how to modify the generated command to upload this sample manually.
